Question 3


1.	Break Statement
Using break, we can force immediate termination of a loop, bypassing the conditional expression and any remaining code in the body of the loop.

2.	Continue Statement
The continue statement is used to skip a part of the loop and continue with the next iteration of the loop. It can be used in combination with for and while statements.

3.	Return Statement
The return statement exits the control flow from the current method and returns to where the method was invoked. The return statement can return a value or may not return a value. To return a value, just put the value after the return keyword.
